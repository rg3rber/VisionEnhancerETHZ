## Overview

Vision Enhancer is a comprehensive Mixed Reality application for the Microsoft HoloLens 2 designed to support individuals with color vision deficiency (CVD) and visual impairments. Leveraging the power of Mixed Reality and Machine Learning, Vision Enhancer aims to break down visual barriers and empower users with tools that improve accessibility in education and beyond.

## Features

1. Colorblindness Filters
        Customizable filters for Protanopia, Deuteranopia, and Tritanopia.
        Enables users to better distinguish colors and identify details, such as numbers in Ishihara test samples, that were previously indiscernible.
2. Magnification Tool
        Magnify hard-to-see areas in real-time using the HoloLens 2 webcam.
        Ideal for reading distant text, such as a blackboard or presentation slides.

3. Text-to-Speech Vision API
        Employs cutting-edge vision model APIs to recognize and read out text.
        Assists users with low vision or reading challenges by combining Mixed Reality and AI-powered accessibility.
